    "In the [Introduction to Quantitative Economics](https://python.quantecon.org/intro.html) with Python lecture series you can learn all about finite-state Markov chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's just concentrate on simulating a very simple example of such a chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the volatility of returns on an asset can be in one of two regimes â€” high or low.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition probabilities across states are as follows ![markov](../data/markov.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let the period length be one day, and suppose the current state is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see from the graph that the state tomorrow will be\n",
    "\n",
    "- high with probability 0.8\n",
    "\n",
    "- low with probability 0.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to simulate a sequence of daily volatility states according to this rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set the length of the sequence to `n = 1_000_000` and start in the high state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a pure Python version and a Numba version, and compare speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test your code, evaluate the fraction of time that the chain spends in the low state.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your code is correct, it should be about 2/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Represent the low state as 0 and the high state as 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you want to store integers in a NumPy array and then apply JIT compilation, use `x = np.empty(n, dtype=np.int_)`.\n"
